This is a simple application to demonstrate Docker and Kubernetes features. It is coposed of two layers:
1. A backend layer which implements the Fibonacci function as a REST API using Flask
1. A front end layer that takes the user input, invokes the REST API, and displays the Fibonacci value in an HTML format
